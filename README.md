1. **Customer** (CustomerID, Name, Email, Phone, DateOfBirth)
2. **Admin** (AdminID, Name, Email, Role, Department)
3. **User** (UserID, Name, Email, Role, Team associations)
4. **Booking** (BookingID, CustomerID, ServiceID, BookingDate, Status)

#### MongoDB (Catalog Data)
**Collections**: Services, Deals - Enhanced with NoSQL flexibility
1. **Service** (_id, Name, Description, Price, Duration, Category, IsVisible)
2. **Deal** (_id, Title, Description, DiscountPercent, ValidUntil, Terms, MaxUses, CurrentUses)

### Database Relationships
- **Customer ‚Üî Service**: Many-to-Many through Bookings table
- **Admin ‚Üî Customer**: Many-to-Many (admin can manage multiple customers)

# Test relationship counts
echo 'Services: ' . \App\Models\Service::count();
echo 'Customers: ' . \App\Models\Customer::count();
echo 'Deals: ' . \App\Models\Deal::count();

# Test M:M relationships
echo 'Customers for first service: ' . \App\Models\Service::first()->customers()->count();
echo 'Services for first customer: ' . \App\Models\Customer::first()->services()->count();

# Test 1:1 relationships
echo 'Deal service: ' . \App\Models\Deal::with('service')->first()->service->ServiceName;
```

### Component Testing

## üçÉ MongoDB Setup & Validation (Viva Guide)

### 1. Where MongoDB Config Lives
- **.env**: MongoDB connection variables (DB_MONGO_HOST, DB_MONGO_PORT, DB_MONGO_DATABASE, etc)
- **config/database.php**: 'mongodb' connection array for Laravel MongoDB package

### 2. Which Models Use MongoDB
- **app/Models/Service.php**: Extends MongoDB\Laravel\Eloquent\Model, uses $connection = 'mongodb'
- **app/Models/Deal.php**: Extends MongoDB\Laravel\Eloquent\Model, uses $connection = 'mongodb'

### 3. How to Seed and Test with Tinker
- **Seeding**: Run `php artisan db:seed --class=MongoDBSeeder` to populate demo services and deals
- **Testing**:
  - Run `php artisan tinker`
  - Try:
    ```php
    App\Models\Service::count(); // Should show 5
    App\Models\Deal::count();    // Should show 3
    App\Models\Service::first(); // View first service
    App\Models\Deal::first();    // View first deal
    ```
- **Quick Test Script**: Run `php test_mongodb.php` for a summary of MongoDB data

### 4. Livewire Components Powered by MongoDB
- **ManageServices**: CRUD for services, all data from MongoDB
- **ManageDeals**: CRUD for deals, all data from MongoDB
- **BookService**: Service selection and booking uses MongoDB service data

### 5. Troubleshooting
- If seeder or test fails, check:
  - MongoDB service is running (`net start MongoDB`)
  - PHP MongoDB extension is installed and enabled
  - .env and config/database.php match your local MongoDB settings

---
**This project uses a hybrid database: SQLite for customers/bookings, MongoDB for catalog (services/deals). All admin and booking features for services/deals are now powered by MongoDB.**
