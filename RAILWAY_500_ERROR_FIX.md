# Railway 500 Error - MongoDB Data Missing

## Issue
✅ MongoDB connected successfully
✅ Variables configured correctly  
❌ 500 error - likely because MongoDB database is empty

## Solution: Seed MongoDB with Services Data

Your Railway MongoDB needs the 37 services and 10 deals that we have locally.

### Option 1: Export & Import MongoDB Data (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Export from Local MongoDB
```bash
# Open PowerShell in your project directory
mongodump --db=luxe_hair_studio --collection=services --out=./mongo-backup
mongodump --db=luxe_hair_studio --collection=deals --out=./mongo-backup
```

#### Step 2: Import to Railway MongoDB

First, get your Railway MongoDB connection string from the `MONGO_URL` variable.

```bash
# Replace <MONGO_URL> with your actual Railway MONGO_URL
mongorestore --uri="<MONGO_URL>" --db=luxe_hair_catalog ./mongo-backup/luxe_hair_studio
```

### Option 2: Use MongoDB Compass (Easier - GUI Tool)

#### Step 1: Download MongoDB Compass
- Download from: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass
- Install it

#### Step 2: Connect to Local MongoDB
```
Connection String: mongodb://localhost:27017/luxe_hair_studio
```

#### Step 3: Export Collections
1. Click on "luxe_hair_studio" database
2. Click on "services" collection
3. Click "..." → "Export Collection"
4. Choose JSON format
5. Save as `services.json`
6. Repeat for "deals" collection → save as `deals.json`

#### Step 4: Connect to Railway MongoDB
```
Use your MONGO_URL from Railway
```

#### Step 5: Import Collections
1. Create database "luxe_hair_catalog" (or use existing one)
2. Create collection "services"
3. Click "ADD DATA" → "Import JSON or CSV File"
4. Select `services.json`
5. Import
6. Repeat for "deals" collection with `deals.json`

### Option 3: Create Seeder for Railway

I can create a seeder script that you can run on Railway to populate the data.

## Which option do you prefer?

**Tell me one of these:**
1. "I'll use mongodump/mongorestore" (Option 1)
2. "I'll use MongoDB Compass" (Option 2)  
3. "Create a seeder script for me" (Option 3)

## Quick Check

Before we proceed, let's verify your Railway MongoDB is empty:

**Question**: Do you have access to view your Railway MongoDB database?
- If YES: Check if there are any documents in the "services" collection
- If NO: We'll assume it's empty and proceed with Option 3

## Why This Happened

Your local setup has:
- ✅ MongoDB with 37 services (with images)
- ✅ MongoDB with 10 deals

Your Railway MongoDB has:
- ❌ Empty database (no services)
- ❌ Empty database (no deals)

The app tries to load services from MongoDB but finds nothing, causing the error.
