## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Variables are case-sensitive** - type them exactly as shown
2. **Railway auto-deploys** - no need to manually trigger deploy
3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** - deployment takes time
4. **Check logs** - Deployments tab ‚Üí View Logs for errors
5. **Hard refresh** - Press Ctrl+Shift+R after deploy

## üìû Ready for Next Steps?

Once you're in Railway dashboard, tell me:
1. "I can see MongoDB service" or "No MongoDB service"
2. "I'm in the Variables tab" 
3. Share screenshot if stuck
