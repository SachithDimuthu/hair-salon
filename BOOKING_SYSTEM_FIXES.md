## 🔧 Quick Testing

To test the booking system:

1. **Access the booking page**: Navigate to `/book-service`
2. **Test each step**:
   - Select a service (should see selection feedback)
   - Pick a date (calendar should work)
   - Choose a time slot (buttons should respond)
   - Select a staff member (selection should be highlighted)
   - Fill in customer details (validation should work)
   - Confirm booking (should show success message)

## 🐛 If Issues Arise

### Clear Caches (Run these commands):
```bash
php artisan view:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
npm run build
```

### Check Database Connection:
```bash
php artisan tinker --execute="echo 'Services: ' . \App\Models\Service::count();"
```

### Check for Errors:
1. Browser Console (F12) for JavaScript errors
2. Laravel Log: `storage/logs/laravel.log`
3. Network tab for failed requests

### Common Solutions:
- **Service images not showing**: Check `public/images/Services/` directory
- **Buttons not working**: Clear browser cache and check console
- **Validation errors**: Check `BookService.php` validation rules
- **Livewire issues**: Ensure `@livewireStyles` and `@livewireScripts` in layout
